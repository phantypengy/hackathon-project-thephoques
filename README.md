Team: Dominik, Sarah, Finnán

## Theme chosen: Old but Gold

Web server 3: Audio/Video streaming server

We're making a video site similar to YouTube, with planned features being:

- Videos stored on a server
- A library where you can save videos (kind of like a watch later playlist)
- Search feature
- Video uploading
